# User Scenarios.

## Two main scenarios.

1. User connects without a unique key in the URL.
2. User connects with a unique key in the URL.

### (SC1) User connects without a unique key

User is asked their name.
Once clicking the submit button a unique key is generated and the user is redirected to the site with this URL appended. At this point the user is at scenario (SC2).

### (SC2) User connects with a unique key

The unique key is show at the top with some helpful message like “keep this” (IDK).

A text box is shown for the user to enter their name. Underneath is a text box that contains the current version of the copy, ready to be edited. Below the text box is the submit button.

Next is a list of the previous versions of the copy consisting of.
1. The date that the copy was uploaded.
2. The name of the person who made the change.

Clicking on either the date or the name of the person shows the copy that was saved at that stage.
If there are changes made after the version of the copy that is being shown, these entries appear before the text box, and entries that were save before appear below the text box.
It is not possible to edit a previous copy, so there isn’t a submit button.
