# CopyCheck

Stop using email to communicate and verify the copy for a website.

## Straight forward workflow.

Start a new version of a piece of copy and get a hash. Put the hash in slack or email it to other people in the team. Using this hash, other can modify the copy. Modifications can be seen by anyone who has the hash. A history of modifications is available.
